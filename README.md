# Swim Tutorial

Swim is a completely integrated solution for building scalable, end-to-end streaming applications. Instead of requiring separate message brokers, app servers, and databases, Swim applications consist of just two pieces:

- A **Swim server** with *built-in* persistence, messaging, scheduling, clustering, replication, introspection, and security

- A **user interface** that uses Swim's streaming UI frameworks to visualize data from Swim servers in real-time

Visit [server](https://github.com/swimos/swim-tutorial/blob/master/server) to learn how to stand up your data in a Swim server.

Then, visit [ui](https://github.com/swimos/swim-tutorial/blob/master/ui) to see this data like never before.
